You probably know me as `cloudhead`. I'm a hacker & artist from France, currently living in Montreal.
I excell at creative problem solving, as well as building invaluable tools for developers.

I enjoy implementing elegant solutions to difficult problems. I'm a fast, intuitive learner,
which has allowed me to acquire a very broad skillset, not strictly limited to technology.

experience
----------
My experience ranges from game programming to web development, all through parsing, auditing and socket programming.
I've enjoyed working with a wide array of technologies, including, but not limited to:
git, MySQL, CouchDB, redis, MongoDB, nginx, thin, rack, Ruby on Rails, jQuery and Node.js,
in languages such as ruby, javascript, C, C++, Objective-C, PHP and Java.

I have commanding knowledge of the HTTP ecosystem, XHR and HTML/CSS.
I am an extremely active open-source software developer, with many actively used projects.
I'm great at communicating knowledge and ideas, and can do so in english, french and spanish.

I have experience implementing database clients, recursive descent parsers, recommendation engines, REST interfaces,
database caching layers, scalable infrastructures, HTTP request routers, testing frameworks and metrics systems, as well as
doing usability testing, web design and wireframing.

culture
-------
I live inside vi, xmonad, zsh and git.

I'm always actively seeking new technologies to master, interesting problems to solve,
and new programming languages to learn and help expand my mind.

I am happiest when working colaboratively, yet independently.

I believe in code as art, and strive to reach that ideal as often as possible.
